# Analysis-of-network-hardening

Overview
This project presents a Security Risk Assessment conducted for a fictional social media organization that recently experienced a major data breach due to undetected vulnerabilities. The assessment identifies security weaknesses and proposes effective network hardening tools and strategies to mitigate risks and prevent future breaches.

ðŸ”Ž Scenario Summary
A major data breach compromised sensitive customer information such as names and addresses. An internal investigation revealed the following vulnerabilities:

Employees sharing passwords.

Default admin password on the database.

Inadequate firewall rules.

Lack of multifactor authentication (MFA).

ðŸ”§ Recommended Network Hardening Tools
The following tools and practices were recommended to address the vulnerabilities:

1. Network Log Analysis
Helps track login attempts and user activities.

Detects suspicious behavior and shared credentials.

2. Password Policy Implementation
Enforces strong, unique passwords.

Removes use of default/admin credentials.

3. Encryption Using Latest Standards
Protects data in transit and at rest.

Works in conjunction with firewall rules for secure network traffic.

4. MultiFactor Authentication (MFA)
Adds a critical second layer of identity verification.

Prevents unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

âœ… Impact
Implementing these tools significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats. The practices are designed to be consistently enforced and monitored as part of the organizationâ€™s ongoing security posture.
